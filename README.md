# Node.JS + MySQL Web App.<br><br>Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

<br>

> **Note:** This is a part of a series of demo projects in which I manipulate a Node.js application using various technologies.<br>
>
> The app built using Node.js and Express, originally presented at this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/otam-mato/nodejs_mysql_web_app_terraform.git).
>
> In the current installment, I am setting up monitoring of the application using Prometheus and Grafana.
<br>

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Prometheus and Grafana Deployment:**
   We will use the Docker-compose file and pull images of Prometheus and Grafana
   
2. **Node.js:**
   We will use the same Docker-compose file to build a container, serving the app

## Functionality

This web application interfaces with a MySQL database, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database records. Monitoring implemented via **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

## Summary

The app sets up a web server for a supplier management system. It allows viewing, adding, updating, and deleting suppliers. 

#### **Dependencies and Modules**:
   - **express**: The framework that allows us to set up and run a web server.
   - **body-parser**: A tool that lets the server read and understand data sent in requests.
   - **cors**: Ensures the server can communicate with different web addresses or domains.
   - **mustache-express**: A template engine, letting the server display dynamic web pages using the Mustache format.
   - **serve-favicon**: Provides the small icon seen on browser tabs for the website.
   - **Custom Modules**: 
     - `supplier.controller`: Handles the logic for managing suppliers like fetching, adding, or updating their details.
     - `config.js`: Keeps the server's settings for connectind to the MySQL database.

#### **Configuration**:
   - The server starts on a port taken from a setting (like an environment variable) or uses `3000` as a default.

#### **Middleware**:
   - It's equipped to understand data in JSON format or when it's URL-encoded.
   - It can chat with web pages hosted elsewhere, thanks to CORS.
   - Mustache is the chosen format for web pages, with templates stored in a folder named `views`.
   - There's a public storage (`public`) for things like images or stylesheets, accessible by anyone visiting the site.
   - The site's tiny browser tab icon is fetched using `serve-favicon`.

#### **Routes (Webpage Endpoints)**:
   - **Home**: `GET /`: Serves the home page.
   - **Supplier Operations**: 
     - `GET /suppliers/`: Fetches and displays all suppliers.
     - `GET /supplier-add`: Serves a page to add a new supplier.
     - `POST /supplier-add`: Receives data to add a new supplier.
     - `GET /supplier-update/:id`: Serves a page to update details of a supplier using its ID.
     - `POST /supplier-update`: Receives updated data of a supplier.
     - `POST /supplier-remove/:id`: Removes a supplier using its ID.

#### **Starting Up**:
   - The server comes to life, starts listening for visits, and announces its awakening with a log message.

**<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Prometheus details</summary>**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and is widely used in the field of cloud-native and containerized applications. Prometheus is used for collecting, storing, and querying metrics and other essential data generated by various software systems.

Key features and components of Prometheus include:

1. **Data Collection**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs, services, and applications at regular intervals. It supports multiple data formats, including a simple text-based format and more efficient binary formats.

2. **Data Storage**: Collected data is stored in a time-series database optimized for fast querying and aggregations. The database can be configured to retain data for a specified time.

3. **Query Language**: Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) allows users to write powerful queries to aggregate, transform, and process data for monitoring and alerting purposes.

4. **Alerting**: Prometheus supports alerting based on defined alerting rules. Alerts can be configured to notify operators or integrate with notification systems like Alertmanager.

5. **Scalability**: Prometheus is designed to be horizontally scalable, and it supports federated setups to collect and aggregate data from multiple Prometheus instances.

6. **Visualization**: While Prometheus itself doesn't provide visualization capabilities, it integrates well with other tools like Grafana for creating dashboards and visualizing data.

7. **Exporters**: Prometheus exporters are small applications or libraries that allow you to monitor various third-party systems, services, and components. Many popular software components have Prometheus exporters available.

Prometheus is often used in combination with other technologies such as Grafana for visualization and Alertmanager for alert management. It's especially popular in containerized and microservices-based environments, helping operators and developers monitor and troubleshoot complex, dynamic systems.
